            <h3>How can we use an inclined plane to prove the coefficient of static friction?</h3>
            <p>
                If we change the angle on an inclined plane, then the magnitude of the static friction will increase up to its maximum value just before the object begins to slide down the ramp. However, the coefficient of static friction will remain constant because it is a ratio of the magnitude of the frictional force and normal force.

            <ol class="tabs">
                <li>
                    Gather materials and construct the plumb line from the protractor, string, and small weight.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Attach a string to the midpoint of the protractor and hang a small object (e.g., a pen) to the end of the string.</li>
                        <li>Attach the protractor to the ramp&mdash;the string should be hanging over the 90&deg; mark.</li>
                        <li>
                            Once the ramp begins to lift, the weight will slide along the protractor. At this point, measure the angle by calculating the difference between 90&deg; and the new angle.
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example: If the the ramp is lifted and the string hovers over the 60 degree mark, the incline is 30 degrees above the horizontal.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Place the first mass on the ramp and begin to lift the ramp.</li>
                <li>Once the mass begins to slide, stop raising the ramp and measure the angle on the plumb line to find the angle of inclination.</li>
                <li>Repeat Steps 2&ndash;3 two more times for the same mass and calculate the average of the collected data.</li>
                <li>Repeat Steps 2&ndash;4 for four more masses.</li>

                    From the chart, an exponential line of best fit is formed. As the masses of the objects increase, minimum angle required for the object to move down the ramp increases. From this, it is clear that the parallel component of the gravitational force (F<sub>&par;</sub>) increases as well, thus causing &vert;&fnof;<sub>s</sub>&vert; to increase. However, when calculating the coefficient of friction, the value should approach a fixed constant.

                <p>
                    In this experiment, we aimed to prove the coefficient of friction between wood and wood. Our results weren&apos;t perfectly reflective of the expected results, as our calculated coefficients of static friction for each mass varied. We hypothesized that if we were to change the angle on an inclined plane, the magnitude of the static friction would increase up to its maximum value just before the object begins to slide down the ramp. However, the coefficient of static friction should remain constant because  it is a ratio of the magnitude of the frictional force and normal force. Some part of our hypothesis was proven by the experiment as we witnessed the block slide down the ramp when the angle was large enough for F<sub>&par;</sub> to exceed &vert;&fnof;<sub>s<sub>max</sub></sub>&vert;. However, the coefficients of friction that we calculated did not prove our hypothesis: instead of getting one value, we calculated a range of coefficients. To calculate our percent error, we took the average of our calculated coefficients of friction and compared it with the range of coefficients of friction of wood on wood, amounting to about 52%.
                </p>
                <h4>Some major findings:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>As the masses of the objects increased, minimum angle required to break the static friction increased.</li>
                    <li>&there4;The parallel component of each object&apos;s gravitational force, F<sub>&par;</sub>, increased along with this trend.</li>
                    <li>&there4; The maximum value of &vert;&fnof;<sub>s<sub>max</sub></sub>&vert; also increased due to Newton&apos; Third Law.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    An abnormality was our wide range of coefficients of static friction. The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces should always be around the same value. The surfaces used were wood on wood, which means that the coefficient of static friction on wood to wood should have a range of 0.25&ndash;0.5, depending on the type of wood (e.g., dry wood, wet wood, clean wood).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our experiment had some limitations. Firstly, we only measured the angle of inclination and basically calculated all of our other data rather than using a device that could have measured the F<sub>N</sub> and F<sub>&par;</sub>. A lot of our data was not precise, thus leaving room for error through all of the rounding and derived formulas. Secondly, our angle measurements may not have been exact due to the fact that we stopped lifting the ramp a couple of degrees <em>after</em> the block started moving. For future experiments, we would use a device to measure force so that the results are precise. We would also complete more trials to add to the viability of our data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this experiment, we were able to witness how an object how friction affects the motion of an object while obeying Newton&apos;s Laws. This can be applied to the real world and provide insight as to why it is easier to keep a box in motion than it is to provide the initial push to move it.
