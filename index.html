                    Whereas many science fair projects begin as a quest to find new knowledge or to test a hypothesis, we have set out to prove an already&#8209;tested value for ourselves. The coefficient of friction (see &ldquo;<a href="friction.html" title="Friction 101">Friction 101</a>&rdquo; for more details) between two wooden surfaces already has an accepted value. Can our experiment match up to the results of professional physicists?

                <h3>Why Friction?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the surface, friction is just an annoying force that makes it harder to do work. However, as is the case with many concepts in physics, there is more to friction than meets the eye. In many cases, friction opposes and causes motion <em>simultaneously.</em> For instance, walking is only possible because of the friction between one&apos;s foot and the ground. In a more traditional physics scenario, a tire spinning backward would not have any traction to propel a car forward. As students in physics class, we had to look further into this surprising and unexpected force (see &ldquo;<a href="friction.html" title="Friction 101">Friction 101</a>&rdquo; for more details).
