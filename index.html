                    Whereas many science fair projects begin as a quest to find new knowledge or to test a hypothesis, we have set out to prove an already&#8209;tested value for ourselves. The coefficient of friction between two wooden surfaces already has an accepted value. Can our experiment match up to the results of professional physicists?

                <h3>Why Friction?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the surface, friction is just an annoying force that makes it harder to do work. However, as is the case with many concepts in physics, there is more to friction than meets the eye. In many cases, friction opposes and causes motion <em>simultaneously.</em> For instance, walking is only possible because of the friction between one&apos;s foot and the ground. In a more traditional physics scenario, a tire spinning backward would not have any traction to propel a car forward. As students in physics class, we had to look further into this surprising and unexpected force.

            <h3>About AP&reg; Physics C&colon; Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The College Board&ast; describes AP&reg; Physics C: Mechanics as the equivalent of &ldquo;a semester&#8209;long, introductory calculus&#8209;based college course in physics.&rdquo; In addition to Mechanics, College Board also offers AP&reg; Physics C: Electricity and Mangetism (E&amp;M), the equivalent of a second&#8209;semester calculus&#8209;based physics course. Although College Board has offered multiple AP&reg; Physics courses throughout the years, the AP&reg; Physics C courses are the only science courses that rely on calculus (note: this is especially true of E&amp;M). One should take this course if interested in a physical science, engineering, or a general challenge!<br>
