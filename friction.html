            <h3>What is Friction?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Friction is a force that resists motion caused by some sort of force between two objects. Friction is present in all aspects of life, from sliding a box across a floor to an object in free&#8209;fall. Friction is always tangential to the contact surface, and it only acts when another force is present that tries to move an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of friction: static friction (denoted as &fnof;<sub>s</sub>) and kinetic friction (denoted as &fnof;<sub>k</sub>). Objects experience static friction when the objects remain at rest while a force is acting on at least one object that has a nonzero component parallel to the ground. In other words, if I were to push a heavy box that does not move, the box is experiencing static friction that opposes my push (i.e., Newton&apos;s Third Law). If the box starts moving, that indicates that my push was stronger than the maximum value of static friction and the box is now experiencing kinetic friction (more on that later). Kinetic friction is generally weaker than static friction, which explains why it is easier to push or pull an already-moving object than it is to move an object from rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the subatomic level, friction can get very complicated. One must take into account the attraction between molecules down to the subatomic particle, and concepts become much blurrier when discussing very small objects. However, when viewing the force in a simplified ideal physics world, one can sum up friction in two formulas:
                </p>
                <p class="equations">
                    0 &le; &fnof;<sub>s</sub> &le; <i>&mu;</i><sub>s</sub>F<sub>N</sub><br>
                    &fnof;<sub>k</sub> = <i>&mu;</i><sub>k</sub>F<sub>N</sub>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice the difference between static and kinetic friction: while the magnitude of static friction can vary within a restricted range of values, there is typically only one value for the magnitude of kinetic friction between two surfaces. This is because static friction is what is known as a <strong>reaction force.</strong> Following Newton&apos;s Third Law, every action produces an equal and opposite reaction.
                </p>
                <p>If there is no force acting perpendicular to the normal force, the object will not experience any friction between itself and the surface that is exerting the normal force (more on that later). Up until the maximum value of <i>&mu;</i><sub>s</sub>F<sub>N</sub>, the magnitude of the frictional force exerted on the object will equal that of the applied force. As stated before, if I push a heavy box that does not move, the box is expering static friction that opposes my push. If the box starts moving, the magnitude of the force I applied has <em>exceeded</em> the value of <i>&mu;</i><sub>s</sub>F<sub>N</sub>, the maximum value of the magnitude of static friction. As long as the box keeps moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction, <i>&mu;</i><sub>k</sub>F<sub>N</sub>, will be less than the maximum value of static friction and it will be easier to move an already-moving box. In the following sections, we will discuss the coefficient of friction and the strange &ldquo;normal force&rdquo;.</p>

                <h3>Coefficient of Friction</h3>
                <p>
                    The coefficient of friction (<i>&mu;</i>) is the dimensionless ratio between the frictional force and the normal force. This ratio is typically less than 1, but objects stuck together that experience significant amounts of friction can share a coefficient of friction greater than 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coefficient of friction is not influenced by mass, shape, or size: it is only influenced by the surfaces of the interacting objects. Generally, rough surfaces share a higher coefficient than smooth surfaces. The general equation for the coefficient of friction is as follows:
                </p>
                <p class="equations">
                    <i>&mu;</i> = <sup>F<sub>&fnof;</sub></sup> &frasl; <sub>F<sub>N</sub></sub>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to the frictional force, there are two types of coefficients of friction: static and kinetic coefficients of friction. The static coefficient of friction is a ratio between two fixed, motionless objects. The kinetic coefficient of friction, on the other hand, is a ratio between two objects such that at least one of them is in motion.
