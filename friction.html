        <h3>What is Friction?</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
                Friction is a force that resists motion caused by some sort of force between two objects. Friction is present in all aspects of life, from sliding a box across a floor to an object in free&#8209;fall. Friction is always tangential to the contact surface, and it only acts when another force is present that tries to move an object.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two types of friction: static friction (denoted as &fnof;<sub>s</sub>) and kinetic friction (denoted as &fnof;<sub>k</sub>).
                 An object is said to experience static friction when the object remains at rest when a force is acting on the object that has a nonzero component parallel to the ground. In other words, if I were to push a heavy box that does not move, the box is experiencing static friction that opposes my push (i.e., Newton&apos;s Third Law). If the box starts moving, that indicates that my push was stronger than the maximum value of static friction and the box is now experiencing kinetic friction (more on that later). Kinetic friction is generally weaker than static friction, which explains why it is easier to push or pull an already-moving object than it is to move an object from rest.

            <h3>Friction Formulas</h3>
            <p>
                At the subatomic level, friction can get very complicated. However, when viewing the force in a simplified ideal physics world, one can sum up friction in two formulas:
            </p>
            <p class="equations">
                0 &le; &fnof;<sub>s</sub> &le; <i>&mu;</i><sub>s</sub>F<sub>N</sub><br>
	            &fnof;<sub>k</sub> = <i>&mu;</i><sub>k</sub>F<sub>N</sub>
            </p>
        </section>

            <h3>Coefficient of Friction</h3>

                &mu; = <sup>F<sub>&fnof;</sub></sup> &frasl; <sub>F<sub>N</sub></sub>
            </p>
